# wake-screen

Short little C# console app to keep the screen awake.

Setup a new console app in Visual Studio using a base template. 
Copy the program.cs code into your program.cs file.
Compile it and run it in the prod release. 
Make a shortcut to the .exe file and put it on your desktop or some other location that is easy to access.
As long as it is running, it will keep your screen saver away and other things active.
I made this with help from ChatGPT so it's not a huge secret. You can modify it to behave however you want fairly easily.
